      <p><i><b>Secondary Education</b></i></p>
      <p>After gaining admission into <i><b>ECWA Staff Secondary School Jos </b></i> farin gada being 10 years old in JSS1, it was a boarding school, it was not particularly easy to settle at the time, due to bullies, the struggle of water and every other challenge. He settled anyway, got use to the system and it didn't stop him from doing great academically as he was always a brilliant student... he got even much better as he got into senior class. By the time he was in SS1, Jonathan (his immediate younger brother) joined him at ESSJ, and in SS3 Israel also joined them both. David always looked after his younger brothers in school and stood up for them when needed. He belonged to Yellow house (Ari) and he was a member of set 2013.</p>

     <p><i><b>Tertiary Education</b></i></p>
     <p>After graduating from secondary and also passing WAEC at his first sitting, he gained  admission into <i><b>Federal University Of Technology Minna</b></i> (FUT minna), to study Computer Science. Being far away from home for the first time alone, he settled with a family of Mr Godiah's friend, (Umar). After a year he eventually moved out and lived like every other student. He once had accident nearly fatal, survived with so many bruises. This affected his academic semester as it took quite a long time to recover. He did his Internship Training (IT) in Jos, and successfully graduated and had his convocation in February 2019. He finished from FUT Minna with a very decent 2nd class upper. He served his country in the NYSC program in Jos for the stipulated time and finished successfully. </p>

    <p><i><b>Secondary Education</b></i></p>
    <p>At 10 yrs old he went off to ECWA Staff School Miango to begin JSS1. It was a boarding house, settling went well but there was a challenge of distance and clashing of events with ECWA Staff farin gada Jos such as, visiting days, resumptions, P.T.A meetings etc. (David was in ECWA Staff farin gada Jos) </p>
    <p>After completing JSS1 in Miango he had to transfer to ECWA Staff farin gada Jos for convenience which meant he had to restart from JSS1 again. He settled easily with already having experience and an elder brother for assistance (David). He belonged to Green house (shelly) and was a king just before graduating. He was a member of set 2016. He graduated 2nd July 2016.</p>

    <P><i><b>Childhood and youth</b></i></P>
    <p>At the time Israel was born the family of Godiah already had two sons (David & Jonathan). He grew quite rapidly being able to walk before age two.

    <p><i><b>Early Education</b></i></p>
    <p>Just a couple of months after turning one year old, Israel was strong enough to enroll at <i><b>King's Kiddies Primary Private  School</b></i> (KKS), started from the basic right through finish in  Primary.He was always punctual also winning most Punctual Pupil (thanks to his dad always dropping him off early on his way to work). Israel was sportive always loved football precisely from that young age.

    <p><i><b>Secondary Education</b></i></p>
    <p>After gaining admission into <i><b>ECWA Staff Secondary School Jos </b></i> farin gada at just 9 years old in JSS1, speculations arise from the school board which suggested he was too young for the challenges, but all later passed away. Israel settled down rather easily thanks to his elder brothers, David at the time already being a senior student made life easier. Israel also began struggling academically compared to the excellent grades from primary school days.</p>
    <p>In senior class he began to pick up and settle more academically, he belonged to Yellow house (Ari) which he was a prince twice before graduating. He was a member of set 2018. Graduated 14th July 2018. at just age 15 being one of the youngest in the set.</p>
